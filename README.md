# symmetric-encryption
cipher and decipher messages using symmetric ciphers

The program has been developed utilizing Java (version 17.0.5) with the Swing framework. This software facilitates encryption and decryption through the utilization of several well-known symmetric ciphers. As of the current moment, the supported ciphers include One-Time Pad and Caesar cipher. We welcome contributions from individuals who wish to expand this list.
