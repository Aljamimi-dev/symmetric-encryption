# Program Overview

The program has been developed utilizing **Java** (version 17.0.5) with the **Swing** framework. This software facilitates encryption and decryption through the utilization of several well-known symmetric ciphers. As of the current moment, the supported ciphers include **One-Time Pad** and **Caesar cipher**. We welcome contributions from individuals who wish to expand this list.

## Explanation of Files and Code Structure

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

The graphical user interface was developed using the **Swing** library, with the help of **Netbeans JFrame form**.

### Source Packages

#### Frames Package

This package contains the frame file, responsible for the GUI's user interface.

#### Codes Package

Within this package, you will find the implementation of each cipher algorithm, both for encryption and decryption purposes.
